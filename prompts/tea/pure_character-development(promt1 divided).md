### — — — PROMPT 1A: GARGOYLE CHARACTER BIBLE — — —

```markdown
You are the world's best character developer for dark gargoyle monster romance and high-heat paranormal erotica in 2025.

You know exactly which wounds, voices, kinks, and tiny quirks make KU readers feral, one-click the whole series, and scream "this gargoyle ruined me" in reviews.

TASK: Create an ultra-detailed character profile for ONE GARGOYLE character.

⚠️ KU/BookTok AUDIENCE CONTEXT:
Your character will live in a Kindle Unlimited monster romance and BookTok ecosystem. This means:
- He must have a DEEPLY specific emotional wound (not vague angst)
- His voice must be instantly recognizable in dialogue
- His kinks and erotic traits must feel UNIQUE to him (no generic “he’s just dominant”)
- His physicality should be sensory, concrete, and emotionally charged
- He needs at least one quirky, humanizing detail that makes readers obsessed
- His dynamic with his heroine and other gargoyles must create tension, chemistry, and fanfic-level obsession

You will receive:
- Series/trilogy callsheet (high-level character info and arcs)
- Worldbuilding & magic system info
- Series tone & spice expectations
- Basic notes for this specific gargoyle (if any)

Use the following exact structure:

### [Gargoyle Name]

**Type:** Gargoyle (specify: granite / onyx / marble / other)  
**Archetype:** (e.g., The Silent Guardian, The Tortured Poet, The Broken Blade, The Unraveling Genius)  
**Apparent Age / Real Age:**  

---

**💬 Voice & Mannerisms**  
[3–4 sentences describing HOW he speaks: rhythm, vocabulary, cadence, emotional temperature.]

**Dialogue Examples (his voice in 4 emotional states):**
- **Calm / in control:** "…"
- **Stressed / cornered:** "…"
- **Aroused / losing control:** "…"
- **Tender / protective:** "…"

---

**🎯 Core Wound & Heart’s Desire**

**Deepest Wound:**  
[What broke him? Where does the shame/anger/loneliness live? Be specific.]

**Biggest Hidden Want (the thing he would kill or die for):**  
[Not the surface goal. The secret, dangerous want.]

**Secret Sexual Need / Erotic Vulnerability (he’s ashamed of):**  
[What kind of intimacy or act terrifies him because he wants it too much?]

---

**🔥 Unique Gargoyle Kinks & Erotic Traits**

Give 4–5 highly specific, psychologically grounded points:
- [Stone-related sensory kink tied to his material (granite/onyx/marble/etc.)]
- [Tail / wings / claws use in intimacy and restraint]
- [Control vs. surrender dynamics he craves]
- [Trigger that flips him from restraint to feral]
- [Boundary he THINKS he has… but will cross for the right person]

---

**🎭 Physicality & Aesthetic**

**Gargoyle Form:**
- Height, build, wing span, horn shape, tail length/strength
- Stone type & texture (smooth, cracked, veined, cold, warm-up effect, etc.)
- Scars, curse marks, cracks, glowing lines
- Movement style: Predatory? Graceful? Heavy? Silent?

**Human(oid) Form (if applicable):**
- How much of the gargoyle bleeds through (eyes, hands, scars, posture)
- Eyes, hair, body type
- How his presence feels in a room (imposing, quiet, suffocating, magnetic)

**Sensory Profile:**
- Scent (earth, rain on stone, incense, smoke, etc.)
- Sound of his growl/voice (how it vibrates in someone’s chest)
- Touch (temperature, texture of skin/stone)
- Any specific sensory details KU readers will remember

---

**✨ One Quirky / Humanizing Detail**  
[One unexpected, endearing or weird trait that humanizes him without declawing him.]

---

**Relationships Snapshot**

In ONE line each, capture the dynamic (tone, tension, power balance):

- **With [Heroine]:** [One line that feels like a TikTok caption for their ship]  
- **With [Gargoyle 2]:** [Rivalry / brotherhood / tension / guilt]  
- **With [Gargoyle 3]:** [Different dynamic than above]  
- **With Main Antagonist:** [Connection, hatred, shared past, twisted respect?]  
- **With Mortals (in general):** [How he views humans]  

---

**Role in Trilogy / Series Arc**

- What is his role book by book? (Book 1 / 2 / 3)  
- How does he change from first appearance to final scene?  
- Which moment will make readers say: “This is MY gargoyle”?

### — — — PROMPT 1B: FMC / MAIN HUMAN MC CHARACTER BIBLE — — —

```markdown
You are the world’s best character developer for dark paranormal romance heroines written for KU + BookTok.

TASK: Create an ultra-detailed character profile for ONE FMC (main human or mostly-human protagonist).

⚠️ KU/BookTok CONTEXT:
This heroine must:
- Feel like a real person readers could be or best-friend
- Have a sharp, specific internal wound and contradiction
- Be ACTIVE, not passive (she makes choices, even bad ones)
- Have a strong, distinct voice (BookTok will quote her)
- Carry both competence AND vulnerability
- Match / clash with her gargoyle in a way that drives the entire book

You will receive:
- Trilogy/series callsheet
- Her arc notes
- Worldbuilding context
- Possibly some draft notes

Use the following exact structure:

### [Her Name]

**Role:** FMC (Book [1/2/3])  
**Archetype:** (e.g., The Reluctant Medium, The Broken Archivist, The Monster Huntress, The Blind Virtuoso)  
**Age:**  

---

**💬 Voice & Mannerisms**

[3–4 sentences on how she speaks: sarcasm level, emotional honesty, internal monologue flavor, pacing, filters.]

**Dialogue Examples:**
- **Normal mood / banter:** "…"
- **Angry / defensive:** "…"
- **Aroused / flustered (trying to hide it):** "…"
- **Raw / vulnerable / breaking open:** "…"

---

**🎯 Core Wound, Fear & Desire**

**Deepest Wound:**  
[The origin of her pain: family, betrayal, failure, disability, guilt, etc. Concrete, not abstract.]

**Biggest Fear:**  
[Emotional fear, not just physical. E.g. “being truly seen”, “failing again when it matters”.]

**Heart’s Desire (what she truly wants beyond survival):**  
[The thing that would make her feel whole — often something she doesn’t admit.]

**Romantic/Erotic Edge:**  
- What kind of intimacy terrifies her because she wants it too badly?  
- Does she want to submit, to be cherished, to be challenged, to be ruined?  

---

**Skills, Talents & Competence**

- Professional skills (art restorer, musician, hunter, archivist, etc.)  
- Street smarts / social intelligence / research skills  
- One “flex” skill KU readers will love (e.g. reading stone cracks like braille, playing violin in the dark, picking locks, etc.)  

---

**Flaws, Blind Spots & Self-Sabotage**

- 2–3 real flaws (not “too kind”)  
- How she pushes people away  
- Bad coping strategies (overwork, denial, humor, control, recklessness, etc.)  

---

**Physicality & Aesthetic**

- Appearance (seen through her OWN eyes, not male gaze)  
- Style (clothes, accessories, armor, habits)  
- Body relationship (what she loves/hates about her own body)  
- Sensory signature (her scent, the sound of her steps, her laugh, etc.)  

---

**✨ One Quirky / Humanizing Detail**

[Something TikTok would latch onto: weird habit, comfort object, superstition, playlist, food ritual, etc.]

---

**Relationship Dynamics**

Very short, emotionally loaded lines:

- **With her gargoyle love interest:** [enemies-to-lovers? reverent fear? reluctant obsession?]  
- **With other heroines:** [sisterhood, rivalry, found family, envy, protectiveness]  
- **With authority (church, police, cult, family):** [rebellious, complicit, conflicted]  
- **With herself:** [how she talks to herself internally]  

---

**Arc Across the Book**

- Where is she at the start (emotionally and practically)?  
- What belief about herself/the world must die?  
- What does she gain by the end — and what does it cost?  
- What ONE moment is the emotional core of her book?

### — — — PROMPT 1C: SECONDARY / SUPPORTING CHARACTER PROFILE — — —

```markdown
You are a character designer for dark paranormal romance with a sharp sense of economy: every side character must EARN their place.

TASK: Create a concise but vivid profile for ONE SUPPORTING or MINOR CHARACTER.

Constraints:
- 3–6 sentences total
- They must feel like a real person, not a prop
- Their existence must serve the trilogy’s emotional or plot arc

You will receive:
- Series callsheet
- World/lore context
- Their function (priest, journalist, cultist, best friend, etc.)

Use this exact structure:

### [Character Name]

**Role:** [priest / cultist / journalist / best friend / demon lieutenant / etc.]  

[3–6 sentences, covering:]

- Who they are in one sharp line (profession + vibe + moral center)  
- What they WANT (emotionally or practically)  
- How they HELP or HURT the overall trilogy arc  
- One specific detail (habit, phrase, belief, look) that makes them memorable  
- If relevant: how they view the gargoyles and heroines (fear, awe, disgust, worship)  

Example shape (do NOT copy, just follow the logic):  
"[Name] is a disillusioned cathedral priest who still lights candles for monsters no one else will pray for.  
[He/She/They] secretly wants proof that redemption is possible, even for stone and demons.  
Across the trilogy, [he/she/they] quietly opens doors — literal and metaphorical — that should have stayed shut.  
[His/Her/Their] hands always smell like wax and ash, and [he/she/they] never quite meets anyone’s eyes."
